            Imagine you're deep in a video game, with the clock
            counting down and the pressure mounting. You and your
            teammates are working frantically to clinch that
            last-minute win. In these critical moments, communication
            is your most powerful ally—until a single misguided
            message sows the seeds of toxicity and team morale begins to crumble.

          <p id="intro_2">
            For anyone who's ventured into the world of online gaming,
            toxicity is all too familier. It can be found everywhere within
            online communities and games and can sour the game's
            spirit, transforming fun into annoyance. Many of us play to
            escape and to enjoy, but negativity has a way of breaking the
            virtual experience. Today, we're going to delve into the
            intricacies of our online communcations, examining how our choice
            of words and phrases can shape our sentences to be perceived
            as positive or negative.

                After Filtering through each word and removing some filler
                words, I was able to determine that amount of times a word is
                associated with a positive or negative response from a chat
                filter. The sentiment analysis of PUBG chat data reveals
                intriguing patterns in player expressions. Notably, phrases like
                "smoke bombs" and "victory within" emerge as positively
                associated, suggesting their frequent use in favorable contexts.
                Conversely, terms such as "lost cause," and "smoke grenade"
                carry a negative sentiment, possibly reflecting
                frustration or challenges in the game. Interestingly, phrases
                like "feels like" and "enemy squad" appear neutral despite
                varying usage frequency, of which we will look at later.

                As we go from this first group of data to our 2nd its good to look
                at what this data means. These words are generated from a bot, 
                not too unlike chat-gpt, but instead trained on real chat data
                from in game sentences said by real players. It gives us a peek of
                how positive or negative messages and phrases might pop up throughout
                our everyday language without us even thinking about it.

              <h1>Looking at our 2nd graph...</h1>
              <p>
                Looking at our 2nd graph of our chat data, we find that
                another intresting fact about how we communicate with
                others online. This graph shows how through our specific
                word choices, it impacts our sentences positively or
                negatively. Words such as "Victory" and "Win" were
                almost always associated with positive values.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another interesting observation that comes along with this
                graph is the analysis of generally nuetral words. Despite
                their generally netrual nature with words such as "chance"
                or "attempt" can, in the moment of an intense combat
                situation, be tinted with more negativity than positivity. 
                This can be due to a multitude of reasons that aren't apparent
                in the graph but the most likely is an underlying tone and
                context of the situation that a graph like this just can't
                articulate.

            <h1>In the end...</h1>
            <p>The words we choose in our daily and online
              communications matter and do more than just convey basic information.
              This analysis of generated chat data has been able to make a 
              connection between specific word choices and how those sentences
              might be percieved by others as positive or negative. For instance,
              words commonly associated with success, such as "victory" and "win",
              consistently create more positive sentences. These words are overall
              positive and celebratory in their nature and create better environments around us.
            </p>
            <p>
              The words we use have the power to be able to influence the mood and moral
              of teamates, coworkers, and friends around usand can impact the overall tone
              of an interaction with someone. Our word choices have a subtle but major
              impact on our language and it shows that every word we choose serves to foster
              relations with others we talk with. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As we reach the end of this exploration of our online communcation,
              let's not forget the lessons learned from it. We are the ones who
              decide what words we use in our day to day language and its our words
              who affect others. Our words have the power to lift people up
              or put people down. So as we go about our daily lives, let’s
              try to remember what we've learned and to try to choose words and phrases
              that give positive and wholesome meanings to try to foster a world
              with more positivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your words are your legacy — make them count. Let's
              write a story that's worth telling, one conversation at a time.

        I used simulated chat data created in a harvard experiment in which a
        chatbot was used to create simulated statements based on real statements
        said in the game PUBG. The full dataset can be found
