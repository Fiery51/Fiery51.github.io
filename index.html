        What words trigger a positive or negative response in the chat filter in
        pubg?

        I used simulated chat data created in a harvard experiment in which a
        chatbot was used to create simulated statements based on real statements
        said in the game PUBG. The full dataset can be found <a href="https://github.com/Fiery51/DataScience1/blob/main/CodeTemplates/Data%20Science%201%20Projects/FinalProject/chat_data.csv">here</a>

          After Filtering through each word and removing some filler words, I was
          able to determine that amount of times a word is associated with a
          positive or negative response from a chat filter

          The sentiment analysis of PUBG chat data reveals intriguing patterns in player expressions.
          Notably, phrases like "smoke bombs" and "victory within" emerge as positively associated,
          suggesting their frequent use in favorable contexts. Conversely, terms such as "lost cause,"
          "chicken dinner," and "smoke grenade" carry a negative sentiment, possibly reflecting
          frustration or challenges in the game. Interestingly, phrases like "feels like" and
          "enemy squad" appear neutral despite varying usage frequency. This analysis sheds light
          on the nuanced sentiments embedded in PUBG chat, providing valuable insights for community
          engagement and game experience enhancement.

        Generally positive words such as "Victory" and "win" were always
        associated with a positive response from the filter. Other words that may
        not have an inherently negative meaning but are most oftenly used more
        negativley than positivley such as "need" and "chance" were most oftenly
        associated with a negative response from the chat filter
